## TODOs

* Include css-in-js (JSS, Styled-Components...)
* Avoid FontAwesome and use SVG icons to reduce FontAwesome script loading time.
* Avoid using dependencies to decode HTML5 Entities that the API returns to improve performance. Make the decoding with pure javascript.
* Make pagination works with a maximum of 50 API results (5 Pages)
* Put order of IDs into operation
